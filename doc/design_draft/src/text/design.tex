\section{Circuit Design}

The following sections describe the specific implementation details of the tDCS current driver. The device can split into three components. The current driver consisting of a digitally controlled voltage source and an analog voltage-to-current converter with digitally selectable gain, A multiplexer/demultiplexer module that allows coupling to a variety of different tDCS systems, and a microcontroller module that acts interfaces with all the digital devices.
